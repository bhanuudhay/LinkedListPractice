# Practice Linked List

Welcome to the Linked List Operations Repository! This project contains various implementations and exercises related to linked list data structures in C++. Each file corresponds to a specific operation or algorithm that can be performed on linked lists.

## üìÅ Contents

### 1. Basic Operations
- **addtwonum.cpp**: Program to add two numbers.
- **countnodes.cpp**: Counts the number of nodes in a linked list.
- **deletenode.cpp**: Deletes a specified node from the linked list.
- **deletewholelist.cpp**: Deletes the entire linked list.
- **inpnelements.cpp**: Inserts elements into the linked list.
- **insertAtpos.cpp**: Inserts a node at a specified position in the linked list.
- **removeduplicate.cpp**: Removes duplicate nodes from the linked list.

### 2. Advanced Operations
- **iscircular.cpp**: Checks if a linked list is circular.
- **iterativereverse.cpp**: Reverses the linked list using an iterative approach.
- **kgrouprev.cpp**: Reverses nodes in groups of `k`.
- **mergeLinkedList.cpp**: Merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
- **middleelement.cpp**: Finds the middle element of the linked list.
- **lastoccurence.cpp**: Finds the last occurrence of a node in the linked list.
- **occurenceofNode.cpp**: Counts the occurrences of a specific node.

### 3. Utility Programs
- **segregateoddeven.cpp**: Segregates odd and even nodes in the linked list.
- **sortevenodd.cpp**: Sorts the linked list by even and odd nodes.
- **sceneriobased1.cpp**: Scenario-based problem solving using linked lists.
- **q5splitting.cpp**: Splits the linked list based on a specific criterion.
- **q9.cpp**: A practice problem involving linked list manipulation.
- **tempCodeRunnerFile.cpp**: A temporary code runner file for testing purposes.
